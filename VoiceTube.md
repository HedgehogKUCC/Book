To end this, I want to share a quote that's been helping me lately.

> If you get tired, rest.<br>
> Don't quit.

Sometimes we get so tired or overwhelmed that we just want to quit.

I know I feel that way sometimes.

But here's a friendly reminder to rest, but don't quit.

You can always take your time and move slower if you need to.

It's better to move slowly than to quit altogether.

Once you've found your inspiration again, you con then keep going.
